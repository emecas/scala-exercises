#Scala Exercises

------------------------

##How it works?

"Scala Exercises" brings the popular [Scala Koans](http://www.scalakoans.org/) to the web. Offering hundreds of solveable exercises organized into 42 categories covering the basics of the Scala language.

- LEARN: Each category includes an explanation of the basics. Learn the concepts through simple code samples.

- SOLVE: Each exercise is a unit test that must pass successfully, complete the exercise by filling in the blanks. Receive instant feedback as your answers are validated in real-time.

- SHARE: The system will consider the category complete when all its exercises are successfully done. Don't forget to share your progress on social networks before moving on to the next category!

- EDIT: After completing a category, you'll be able to go back and edit it. Add new exercises or improve existing ones by sending a pull-request.
